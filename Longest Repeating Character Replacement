This solution maintains a sliding window represented by the left and right pointers. 
It uses a dictionary char_count to keep track of the count of characters 
in the current window. The max_count variable is updated to store the
maximum count of any character in the window. 
If the difference between the window size and the max_count exceeds k, 
it means we need to replace more than k characters, 
so the left pointer is moved to shrink the window.
def characterReplacement(s, k):
    if not s:
        return 0

    max_length = 0
    max_count = 0

    # Dictionary to store the count of characters in the current window
    char_count = {}

    # Pointers for the sliding window
    left = 0

    for right in range(len(s)):
        # Update the count of the current character in the window
        char_count[s[right]] = char_count.get(s[right], 0) + 1

        # Update the maximum count of any character in the window
        max_count = max(max_count, char_count[s[right]])

        # Calculate the length of the window
        window_size = right - left + 1

        # Check if we need to replace more than k characters
        if window_size - max_count > k:
            # Move the left pointer to shrink the window
            char_count[s[left]] -= 1
            left += 1

        # Update the maximum length of the window
        max_length = max(max_length, window_size)

    return max_length

# Example usage:
s = "ABAB"
k = 2
result = characterReplacement(s, k)
print(result)
